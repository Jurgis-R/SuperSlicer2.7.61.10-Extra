/* Pure tower layout uses millimeters and owns only value arrays, never a plan.
   Source layer groups are in print order, even when their Z decreases. A close
   group (its bottom overlaps the tower top) always shares the top tower layer;
   an equal or lower group shares it while the fused depth stays within the
   largest used depth so far, otherwise a layer is stacked above using the
   thinnest source layer's height.
   Bands reserve connected transverse lines using rounded Flow volume and spacing;
   suffix maxima make the tower no deeper toward its top, with no minimum depth.
   Sparse skipping looks ahead so a later printed layer remains within every
   involved tool limit.
   A floating band at or below the tower top is laid out with the other bands;
   above it, its source layer becomes one floating layer holding only that band,
   added after depth and cone so it changes neither; its own depth is its used
   depth. The cone base is calculated whenever the configured angle is positive. */
