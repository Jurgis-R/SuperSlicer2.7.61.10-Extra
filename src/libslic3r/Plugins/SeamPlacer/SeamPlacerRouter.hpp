Regional seam-provider router used by extrusion-tree ordering plugins.

Construction reads every PrintRegion selector, creates one shared session per
selected provider, and resolves every atomic plan loop to one LayerRegion. The
resulting tables are immutable, so place_seam() may be called concurrently by
ordering workers. The Print, PrintingPlan, regions, and loop handles are all
borrowed and must outlive the router.
