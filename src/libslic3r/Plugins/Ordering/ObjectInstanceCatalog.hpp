/*
PrintingPlan object-instance catalog
====================================

The ordering plan records object-instance IDs while its groups and extrusion
trees are built. This provider completes the descriptive metadata for those
entries through the public plugin API. Registration is append-only: the
provider never assigns IDs, freezes the catalog, or retains data-tree views.

Physical instances keep their source Object and local instance index. Synthetic
entries, used by work that has no physical source instance, keep only a copied
name and projected outline. The plan owns the copied metadata; source views are
borrowed only for the duration of this call.
