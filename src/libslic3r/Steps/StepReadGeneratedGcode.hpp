/*
Generated G-code reading and print statistics
==============================

This host-only phase follows STEP_GCODE but is not a selectable slicing step.
The writer has already completed its artifact and stored the path of a readable
text representation in Print. This phase streams that text through the Reader
selected by the firmware and builds the legacy GCodeProcessorResult expected
by GCodeViewer.
Measured role/tool volumes are converted to print totals and the wipe-tower
share. The CLI explicitly requests a local reread after export; exports without
a requested viewer result do not trigger reading in the pipeline.

The caller decides whether a Reader failure is fatal. run() reports failures as
exceptions and never removes or modifies the producer-owned source file.
