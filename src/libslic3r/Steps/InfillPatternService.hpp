/* Host side of the INFILL_PATTERN service.

   INFILL_PATTERN plugins are not slicing steps: another step plugin asks the
   host to run one of them on one surface. STEP_INFILL generators and
   STEP_SUPPORT_TOOLPATH algorithms both do this through the C callbacks
   resolve_pattern_id() and generate_pattern() of their payload. Those callbacks
   forward to one InfillPatternService owned by the step run.

   How to use it from a step:
   1. Build one service before any plugin of the step can call a pattern. The
      constructor gives every active pattern plugin a compact runtime id (1, 2,
      ...; 0 stays INFILL_PATTERN_RUNTIME_ID_INVALID), its guarded host context,
      its error flag and a prepared plugin_run_context.
   2. Let the step plugin translate the configured string id with
      resolve_pattern_id(), then fill a run_ctx_infill_pattern and call
      generate_pattern().
   3. setup() of a pattern must run once in the step before its first call,
      because it binds per-run plugin state such as progress reporting.
      STEP_INFILL calls initialize_pattern() once per used pattern with its
      discovered work groups (lightning builds per-object caches there); a
      service built with SetupPatterns::Refuse does it in the constructor with
      an empty payload.

   Concurrency: after construction the service is never modified. Lookups only
   read its maps, a call copies the prepared run context, and the orchestrator
   message list and plugin storage have their own locks. Several threads may
   therefore call resolve_pattern_id() and generate_pattern() at the same time,
   which STEP_SUPPORT_TOOLPATH does when it runs objects in parallel. */
