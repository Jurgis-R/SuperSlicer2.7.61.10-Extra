WIPE_TOWER_WIPE: non-exclusive geometry services driven by a tower manager
=======================================================================

The default manager adds forced contour-tool visits before calling every selected
service in priority order for EDIT, then every service in that order for COLLECT.
Forced contour visits are limited to owner layers through the last layer with a
tool change in the unmodified plan: a concrete visit's extruder differs from the
previous visit, including across layer/group boundaries. The initial selection
is not a change. No forced visit is added for an owner with no such layer.
Above that boundary, an absent configured contour tool is not added; maintenance
uses the first tower visit's tool, as when forced contour changes are disabled.
Only towers with at least one printed layer receive a synthetic catalog entry.
After reserving all bands, it calls the reporting service once per request for
GENERATE, in plan-anchor order; equal anchors retain service collection order.
Calls, including setup/setup_run/run, are sequential; a service need not support
concurrent calls within this manager run. setup receives data == NULL once;
setup_run and run receive this phase payload. No service is called when the
configured towers are ineligible, or there are no active services.

Tower choice uses the first PrintingExtrusion of an incoming part's tool visit,
regardless of its insertion index. An empty incoming visit uses the next extrusion
in tool-visit order inside the same layer group. For an outgoing-only request,
the extrusion at its anchor index is following; an end anchor searches later
tool visits in that layer. If no following extrusion exists, use the nearest
preceding extrusion in that same layer. No search crosses a layer-group boundary.
An instance tower takes precedence over the global tower; when neither exists,
the request is silently dropped. A source-less extrusion has no instance tower.

Phase payload availability (print and const plan are valid in every phase):
  EDIT:     mutable_plan is valid; report_context, report_request, request,
            band, and exit are NULL. Only this phase may adjust the plan.
  COLLECT:  mutable_plan is NULL; report_context and report_request are valid;
            request, band, and exit are NULL. Report value-only requests without
            changing the plan. Anchors refer to the plan after ALL EDIT calls.
  GENERATE: mutable_plan, report_context, and report_request are NULL; request,
            band, and exit are valid. Modify only band output roots and *exit;
            neither the plan nor the request/band descriptors may be changed.

Frames and units:
  Band min/max/entry and returned exit are XY millimeters in the tower's local
  frame. Local X lies in [0, W], and increasing Y points toward the open side.
  print_z, layer_height, and extrusion_width are millimeters; purge_volume is
  cubic millimeters. In contrast, geometry points written into output roots use
  Slic3r scaled integer coordinates IN THAT SAME LOCAL FRAME (scale mm before
  writing c_point values). Geometry property width/height remain millimeters,
  flow is mm3/mm, and explicit EPropertySpeed speeds are mm/s. Wipe services own
  their speeds; the default object-speed plugin does not assign wipe speeds.
  Source layer groups are assigned in print order to increasing tower Zs. A close
  group (its bottom overlaps the tower top) always shares the top layer, so its
  few bands never push the tower top above the source Zs; an equal or lower group
  shares it while its bands fit the tower's largest usage so far, otherwise a
  layer is stacked above using the source group's thinnest layer height. Band
  print_z can therefore differ from
  the anchor group's print_z. The manager sets a root EPropertyZOffset to their
  difference, in scaled coordinates, on both service output and maintenance.
  A request with a nonzero floating flag never makes the tower grow. The manager
  lays out the other requests first: a floating request whose source Z is at or
  below that tower top is laid out with them, exactly like a normal request.
  Above the top, its band is reserved as the first band of its own floating layer
  at the source Z; that layer receives no maintenance and changes neither the
  layer depth nor the cone.

Output handling:
  Roots start empty and are owned by the manager, not the service's storage.
  A service may move its temporary geometry into them, but may not free or retain
  the roots. A disabled request part has a NULL root. The manager drops untouched
  roots (no local points, children, or properties); property-only command output
  is retained. It rotates each retained root about the local origin, then
  translates it to the platter position, fixes the root as non-sortable and
  non-reversible, and moves it into a PrintingExtrusion with role WIPE_TOWER,
  the synthetic tower catalog id, and no source region island. All generation
  finishes before descending-anchor insertion; equal anchors retain collection
  order. The manager generates brim, perimeter, unused-area fill and optional cone
  after all GENERATE calls, placing maintenance before the bands of its visit.
  Only after all insertion does it remove its otherwise empty forced visits.

Lifetime and failures:
  All payload pointers and views are borrowed only for the current callback.
  report_context/report_request may only be used synchronously during COLLECT.
  The reporter copies *request before returning, so the submitted value may be
  stack-local or reused immediately. GENERATE's request is a manager-owned copy;
  band, roots, and exit remain manager-owned. exit starts at band.entry; services
  may return their last local XY point through it. That exit becomes the suggested
  entry of the next band on the same tower and target tool visit (incoming visit
  when present, otherwise outgoing). New visits use alternating band sides.
  Do not retain any of these pointers.
  The reporter returns 1 after copying a request and 0 for invalid arguments or
  allocation failure. A service must stop on reporter failure and report plugin
  errors using its host context; the dispatch callback returns 0 on failure and
  the host preserves the original service diagnostic/exception for the step.
