A rule is one reason to keep target_key editable. Several rules may share the

- the clauses of one rule are combined with a logical AND;
- the target is enabled when at least one rule registered for it evaluates to
  true (OR). There is no separate "must hold" rule kind: every caller that
  registers a rule for a setting declares a condition under which that setting
  is useful to someone.

A setting with no rule at all stays enabled.

- scope restricts a rule to GUI contexts that refresh one preset kind.
  RAW_PRESET_TYPE_NONE applies to every context. The FFF print settings use
  RAW_PRESET_TYPE_FFF_PRINT so their rules are never evaluated while the
  printer or SLA tab refreshes.
- target_index and the clause condition_index are used for vector/extruder
  options. Use RAW_GUI_RULE_INDEX_ALL for scalar options or when the whole
  field should be affected. Use RAW_GUI_RULE_INDEX_CURRENT for a target that
  must be applied item by item in the current extruder loop.
- struct_size must be set to sizeof(raw_gui_rule) and clause_struct_size to
  sizeof(raw_gui_rule_clause). They allow later additions to the structures
  without breaking already compiled callers: the host rejects a descriptor
  whose struct_size or clause_struct_size is smaller than the host layout.

Rules whose target setting is not defined yet are queued and attached when the
definition appears; a non-blocking warning lists the keys that never appeared.

Rejected descriptors are never stored and are reported through the host log.

Returns:
- 1 when the rule was added;
- 0 when an identical rule was already registered;
- -1 when the descriptor is invalid. Validation rejects a null descriptor or
  a truncated struct_size, an unknown condition or scope, a negative
  target_index or condition_index other than RAW_GUI_RULE_INDEX_ALL and
  RAW_GUI_RULE_INDEX_CURRENT, a null or empty target_key or clause
  condition_key, a null clause array or an empty clause list, and a
